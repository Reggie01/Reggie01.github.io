Build a Calculator Interpreter part 4
==========

Zipline: Build a JavaScript Calculator
 
 a. Ruslan's Exercises for part 4 are 
     I. Write a grammar that describes arithmetic expressions containing any number of +, -, *, or / operators. With the grammar you should be able to derive expressions like “2 + 7 * 4”, “7 - 8 / 4”, “14 + 2 * 3 - 6 / 2”, and so on.
     II. Using the grammar, write an interpreter that can evaluate arithmetic expressions containing any number of +, -, *, or / operators. Your interpreter should be able to handle expressions like “2 + 7 * 4”, “7 - 8 / 4”, “14 + 2 * 3 - 6 / 2”, and so on.
     III. If you’ve finished the above exercises, relax and enjoy :)
 
b.Target Audience
  This is for anyone following along with Ruslan's blog that want to see a js implementation, FCC campers building a calculator or someone looking for basic information on interpreters.
  
  
II. First Talking Pt.
    The grammer I chose to solve the first problem. things to cover are rehash on rules, terminals, non-terminals, head, body, start

III.
   My implementation of the former grammar. How I already solved the problem. How I will clean the code up implementing grammar to source code rules discussed in the translation. So i needed to add two methods expr and factor.

IV.
   any further design decisions that I made.
  
V.
   Thank Ruslan for the blog. Encourage campers to keep learning Discuss insights I've gained like hey the grammar is starting to look like source code. My brain is grasping it but my semantic reasoning takes a little second to catch up.
