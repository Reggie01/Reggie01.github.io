Title: Random Quote Generator SEO
Problem: 
Random quote machine had 73 views and 0 likes.
- Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage had 572 views and 7 likes. 
- random quote machine should have at least 500 likes or more.

How you approach it:
Look up project title in google. See who has the highest rankings, blogs or codepen tags. 
Look up the top blogs in google keyword planner to see their use of keywords.
Look up their project in codepen and look for SEO like title and tags.
Make list of keywords and tags.

Challenges you faced:
