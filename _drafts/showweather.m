Title: Random Quote Generator SEO
Problem: 
Random quote machine had 145 views and 0 likes.
- Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage had 572 views and 7 likes. 
- random quote machine should have at least 500 likes or more.

How you approach it:
Look up project title in google. See who has the highest rankings, blogs or codepen tags. 
Look up the top blogs in google keyword planner to see their use of keywords.
Look up their project in codepen and look for SEO like title and tags.
Make list of keywords and tags.
- Bloggers I compared myself to.
  1. https://htovey.com/ 896 views, 5 likes
  2. https://www.gorkahernandez.com/blog/fcc-zipline-random-quote-machine-js/ 

- Codepen users:
  1. https://codepen.io/denmch/pens/popular/  5,297 views, 0, 27 likes
  2. http://codepen.io/Autophagy/pens/popular/ 614
  
  

Challenges you faced:
Determine why bloggers writing about project ranked higher than project on codepen. Why some bloggers ranked higher than other bloggers. 
Keyword requires that you run an active campaign. Additional options are Bing and Bing Webmaster

Outcome of efforts:
Checking daily stats in codepen to see if view count and likes go up.
