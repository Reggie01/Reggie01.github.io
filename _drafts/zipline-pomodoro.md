Question: Where can I get free sound effects to play with my pomodoro clock?
Hint: [Freesfx](http://www.freesfx.co.uk/soundeffects/all_bells/) offers free sounds that you can use with your project. You will need to sign up with their website to download sounds. Also, attribution is required so make sure to read their license terms.
    
Question: How do I get audio to work with this project?
Hint: You can read about HTML5 audio and video at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video); Read the sub-heading <em>Controlling media playback</em> for example.

Place this code in your html file.
<code>
    <audio src="name_of_your_file.mp3" preload="auto" ></audio>
</code>

Place code in your javascript where you change from session to break and vice versa.
<code>
    var audio =  document.getElementByTagName("audio")[0];
    audio.play();    
</code>

This is one way to get audio to play.
