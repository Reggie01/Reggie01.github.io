Question: How do I call and handle an array of ajax requests?
Hint: I recommend reading this article [Writing better AJAX](https://medium.com/coding-design/writing-better-ajax-8ee4a7fb95f) sub-heading <em>Handling arrays of returned deferred objects</em>. I created an array of deferred objects using the <code>.map()</code> method. Next, I used the $.when() jquery method which allows gives you the ability to call a callback on mutiple deferred objects. Lastly, the callback is executed when I pass it to the $.then() jquery method.
