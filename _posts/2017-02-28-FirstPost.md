Hello, nice to meet you. Today I'm writing my first blog. I have been following free code camp curriculum for over a year and half. I feel like my progress has been up and down. The main reason is because I did'nt get involved in the community enough. IMO, learning to code alone is only so helpful. You need to communicate your ideas with a variety of people, techies, marketers, etc. By sharing knowledge and receiving feedback you can create a positive feedback loop to accelerate your learning process. 

Every camper will at some point have to follow the Read-Search-Ask paradigm to solve a difficult problem or challenge in Free Code Camp curriculum. So eventually you start practicing "google-fu" daily. The sea of blog posts, tutorials, and books can make you feel lost on what path to take. My suggestion is to start with the documentation on [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), my number one resource. As a beginner mdn documentation can seem like a foreign language. In truth, programming like all areas of expertise have their own "secret language". I hope my posts provide some training wheels while you level up your documentation reading skills.

Initially, I will blog about Free Code Camp projects. I will discuss the unique challenges to each problem. If there are too many unique problems in a challenge I will break the challenges down into sub-problems. The sub-problems may become a post themselves. Since your time is valuable, shorter post with images can be used for clarity.

The blog post are written for anyone that is solving similar problems as campers in Free Code Camp. Some Free Code Camp challenges are universal and presented to students using different programming languages. One example of a universal project is the calculator project. Many schools and online courses have a calculator project. My target language to explain concepts will be javascript. Later, Free Code Camp projects will require libraries or frameworks, such as Angular js or React js. Free Code Camp users will probably see the most benefit from my blog posts because they are following the same curriculum.

First, if you have not already signed up with Free Code Camp, I suggest joining the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) community. Familiarize yourself with their map so you can follow along with the projects. Sign up at [Free Code Camp Forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/) so you can actively discuss problems and solutions with the community. Lastly, participate in [Free Code Camp chat](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/freecodecamp) on gitter. These three resources should help you a lot. Lastly, you can contact me through twitter if you have suggestions or questions about the solutions I post. Currently, I do not have a comment section added to my blog. I will probably add one at a later date.

With zero blogging experience I am expecting this blog to be an overnight success. While millions of other bloggers pour their blood, sweat and tears into making it in the blogging world. I will not. I will write inconsistently, creating a post once every 2 to 3 months. 
Terrible joking aside, I plan to post 1 to 2 articles every week. I want this blog to become one of many helpful resources for Free Code Campers and javascript users. The next couple of months, I will cover front end projects. Till next time, have a good day.
