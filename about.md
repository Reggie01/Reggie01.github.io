Hi, my name is Reggie Sanders. I'm currently working through fcc, freeCodeCamp. fcc is an online open source community that helps you learn to code.

I started this blog to chronicle my journey to be a JavaScript Jedi. Along the way I want to help others by providing resources to learn about programming in JavaScript.

My current goal is to finish fcc Data Visualization certification and Back End Development certification.
